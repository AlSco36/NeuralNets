# In Class Exercise 1 - Deep Neural Networks

(1) Install Tensorflow (this is what we will use to build a DNN) using the following command: 
`pip install tensorflow`

(2) Install Black for Jupyter (this will allow the formatting / debug checker to run on *.ipynb files):
`pip install black[jupyter]`

(3) Fork this repository.

(4) Open DNN_ICE1.ipynb. Follow the instructions within the notebook to edit the code. 

(5) Run Black to check your code for minor errors and improper formatting using the following command (I did this in the terminal within VS code):
`black --check .`
If the output does not say "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.", you'll need to edit the code to resolve the issue. You can take a look at how Black would reformat your code using `black --diff .` Edit the code accordingly to resolve the issue and run again. Repeat until the output is "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.". You could also simply run `black .` to automatically make the changes, but I strongly recommend you understand what changes are made prior to submitting your file. For troubleshooting and more ways to use Black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html

(6) Upload your GitHub repository into Gradescope under "ICE1 - DNN" assignment by TX, 1159. If the autograder fails, you did not successfully run Black. You can resubmit as many times as needed prior to the due date. You are also encouraged to schedule time for EI to debug as needed: [Book here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/94f514961fa3476ab9598d4a2173d076@afacademy.af.edu?anonymous&ep=plink)


# In Class Exercise 2 - Deep Neural Networks in Nengo

(1) Install NengoDL (this is what we will use to build a DNN in Nengo) using the following command: 
`pip install nengo-dl`

(XX) Fork this repository.

(XX) Open nengoDNN_ICE2.ipynb. Follow the instructions within the notebook to edit the code. 

(XX) Run Black to check your code for minor errors and improper formatting using the following command (I did this in the terminal within VS code):
